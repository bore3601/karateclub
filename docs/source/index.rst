Karate Club Documentation
===============================

*Karate Club* is an unsupervised machine learning extension library for [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/).

*Karate Club* consists of state-of-the-art methods to do unsupervised learning on graph structured data. To put it simply it is a Swiss Army knife for small-scale graph mining research. First, it provides network embedding techniques at the node and graph level. Second, it includes a variety of overlapping and non-overlapping commmunity detection methods. Implemented methods cover a wide range of network science ([NetSci](https://netscisociety.net/home), [Complenet](https://complenet.weebly.com/)), data mining ([ICDM](http://icdm2019.bigke.org/), [CIKM](http://www.cikm2019.net/), [KDD](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/)), artificial intelligence ([AAAI](http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/conferences.php), [IJCAI](https://www.ijcai.org/)) and machine learning ([NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), [ICML](https://icml.cc/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/)) conferences, workshops, and pieces from prominent journals.
